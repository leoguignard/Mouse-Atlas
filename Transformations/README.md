# Transformations

A library to handle transformation matrices from Christoph Gohlke: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/transformations.py.html

I just copied the source code so it can be easily "installed" and called by other python programs. The code will not be updated and therefore you might be able to find newer/better versions on CG website https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke .

The License is described in the LICENSE file.

## Installation
```shell
python setup.py install --user
```

## Usage
Once installed, functions described there can be imported in the following way:
```python
from Transformations.transformation import shear_from_matrix
```
